<p class="sansserif">Playing with the cat is fun! Here is how to do it. First, you need to get the cats toy (use a string toy. If you don't have a toy, <a href="toy.html">here is how to make one!</a> Next, find your cat. Now, lower down the string toy to them, slowly so you don't scare your cat away! It might hit the toy or bite it! If it doesn't do anything, you can encourage it to play by moving the toy around. If it still doesn't do anything it probably doesn't want to play. Try again later if this happens!</p>
